            "response": "The substance on Arrakis that makes interstellar travel possible is **the spice melange**.  \n\nWhile the provided excerpts from *The Dune Encyclopedia* do not explicitly mention it in the quoted sections, within the broader Dune universe the spice is unique to Arrakis and is essential because it grants the Spacing Guild Navigators the heightened prescient awareness they need to safely guide starships through foldspace. Without spice-enhanced prescience, interstellar travel using the Holtzman effect would be fatally dangerous due to the inability to avoid obstacles during faster-than-light jumps.  \n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n**Spice melange**, found only on Arrakis, makes interstellar travel possible because it allows Guild Navigators to safely navigate foldspace using prescient abilities.  \n\nWould you like me to check *within the text of the Encyclopedia itself* for the exact passages where it links spice to space travel?",
